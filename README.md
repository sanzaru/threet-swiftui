#  ThreeT

## Just a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game

ThreeT, or simpler 3T, is the rewrite in SwiftUI of an old text based C++ version of Tic-Tac-Toe I wrote some time ago (https://github.com/sanzaru/threet).
The goal of this project is not to be a serious competitor. It is more a personal learning project for me to get more into SwiftUI programming.
