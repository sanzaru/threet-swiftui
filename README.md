#  ThreeT

## Just a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game

ThreeT or 3T is the implementation of  an old text based version I wrote some time ago (https://github.com/sanzaru/threet) in SwiftUI.
The goal of this project is not to be a serious competitor. It is more a personal learning project for me to get more into SwiftUI programming.
